# BookMania User Microservice

This repository contains the **User Microservice**, developed as part of the **Software Engineering Methods** course at TU Delft. The User Microservice provides user management functionalities and integrates with other microservices to create a collaborative BookMania system.

## Features

- **User Management**:
  - Create, update, deactivate, and delete user accounts.
  - Manage user profiles with attributes such as bio, location, favorite genres, and favorite books.
  - Role-based access control (User, Author, Admin).

- **Integration with Other Microservices**:
  - Interaction with the Bookshelf microservice for favorite books and genres.
  - Support for analytics and logs tracking user activity.

- **Security**:
  - Proxy design pattern to protect sensitive data, such as user passwords.
  - Compliance with privacy regulations for account and data management.

- **Scalability**:
  - Chain of Responsibility design pattern for modular analytics processing.
  - Extensible architecture enabling easy integration of additional features.
